# 10-MinCode
The name says it all.


Okay, First thing I made was a Fahrenheit to Celcius calculator and vice-versa.
I went over the time by 22 Seconds. Meaning that it took me 10 Minutes and 22 Seconds.

It was coded in Lua and I do feel ashamed of taking more that the limit, since Lua is such a simple Language and I thought I had some quick thinking abilities.
Well the more you learn the better, now I know, I gotta start getting better into thinking faster and managing time properly.


# Ill continue tomorrow with Python.
# This Repo was a made as a way into making my quick coding abilities better.





# Thank you for reading till the end... goobyeeeeeee :)
