# 10-MinCode

The name says it all

Alright, so the first thing I did was doing a calculator to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa. Gotta admit, I took a bit longer than expected, going over by 22 seconds. Ended up taking me a total of 10 minutes and 22 seconds.

Gotta say, I felt a guilty for going over the time limit, especially considering that Lua is supposed to be a easy. Gotta work on thinking fast and managing my time better ig.

Here's what I've managed to do so far:

- Built a F° to C° Calculator.

Wish you a good sleep lol.
